This is a space I can use to document and keep track of all the programming concepts for my students AS Level Computer Science stuff, hopefully I can keep them well paced and structured so they can easily follow along as we go.

Here's some stuff that we need to cover:

- [[Variables]] and [[Constants]]. This includes what they are, how to utilise (declare, assign, etc) them and some conventions we should probably know.
- [[Conditionals]]- and all their little variants. These will aid in understanding how to make the computer hop around, repeat stuff, and just the basis of most logical operations withing computers.
- [[Functions and Procedures]]. Fortunately it doesn't need to get into any crazy multilayered methods that branch across dimensions and can do some next level mutation- but they should help explore the concepts of creating modular and reusable bits of code to make a project a lot cleaner.
- Program Design. From what I can tell by browsing the sylabus
