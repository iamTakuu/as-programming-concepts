# CIE AS/A Level Computer Science Programming Notes

I need to start organising my thoughts and teaching approaches a bit better in order to try stay on top of stuff, so I've created this [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vault. 

This information is also just to ensure I can always find these notes and refer to them if need be, but I have also chosen to just toss this on the web for anyone who may stumble across it in times of need. I believe that any form of educational information should always be accessible to students and hence, we're here.

IF ANYONE CHOOSES TO ADD ANYTHING TO THIS JUST REMEMBER THIS IS AN [OBSIDIAN VAULT](https://help.obsidian.md/Files+and+folders/Manage+vaults), SO DO WITH THAT AS YOU WILL.

I just git commit lol.

## Getting Started

Anyway to get started, go down to [[The Why-]]. I will also include an [[Index]] you can take a peep at.

Good luck, I wrote my A Levels in 2020, and it's interesting to see how much the syllabus continues to evolve.
